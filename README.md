Cosmic Encounter is a strategy board game where players take turns going on encounters in attempt to control other player's planets. Each player takes on an alien power at the start of the game, which allows them to modify some aspect of play. This simulator models the game of Cosmic Encounter with various alien powers. 

In the future, there will be options to play individually once the AI for the computers is better.

Basic Rules (copied from the Reference section of the Cosmic Encounter Rulebook - https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/11/c6/11c61988-bb60-428f-b614-9c3a952f070b/cosmic-encounter-rulebook.pdf):

A Player’s Turn
The offense (the active player) has one encounter
with another player. If the offense wins that encounter
or successfully makes a deal, the offense
may have a second encounter with another player.
Afterwards, play passes to the left.
Phases of an Encounter

1. Regroup: The offense retrieves one ship from
the warp.
2. Destiny: The offense draws a destiny card to
determine the defense and target system.
3. Launch: The offense aims the hyperspace gate
at one of the defense’s colonies in the target
system and places up to four ships in the gate.
4. Alliance: The offense invites allies, then the
defense invites allies. Starting to the left of the
offense and continuing clockwise, allies join sides
and send up to four ships each to help their side.
5. Planning: The offense and the defense each select
an encounter card and play them facedown.
6. Reveal: The offense and the defence turn their
encounter cards faceup and add up their totals.
7. Resolution: Players determine the winner of
the encounter and resolve any effects from the
encounter
